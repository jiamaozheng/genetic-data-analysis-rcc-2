# Analysis of Genetic Data 2:<br>Mapping genetic associations with testis weightâ€”a first pass

Explain aim for this next episode. Most of the work is getting the
data in the right format.
 
However, we discovered a problem in the previous episode: the rows of
the phenotype data table (**pheno.csv**) do not line up with the rows
of the genotype data table (**cfw.ped**). In the first part of this
episode, we will use R to package up the phenotype data in the right
format so that we can (correctly!) run an association analysis using
PLINK.
