## General Information

Following from [Analysis of Genetic Data
Part 1](https://github.com/pcarbo/genetic-data-analysis-rcc-1), in this
2-hour workshop we will use PLINK, GEMMA and R to generate interesting
biological insights from large-scale genetic data. We will also use
online databases such as the UCSC Genome Browser to interpret the
output of the data analyses. Although no background in genetics is
required to follow the examples, participants with exposure to
concepts in modern quantitative genetics will be in a better position
to benefit from this workshop. Since we cannot work with human data
due to data sharing restrictions, we will download and investigate
data from a mouse genetics study.

**Level:** Intermediate

**Prerequistes:** This workshop assumes some experience performing
simple tasks in a UNIX-like shell environment, as well as basic
familiarity with R. Participants must be able to log in to the RCC
compute cluster, although experience using the RCC cluster is not
required. All participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or
Windows operating sytem that they have administrative privileges on.
*Note:* Attending
[Part 1](https://github.com/pcarbo/genetic-data-analysis-rcc-1) is
*not* required for the second part.

**Where:** Kathleen A. Zar Room, John Crerar Library, University of
  Chicago ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=john%20crerar%20library#map=18/41.79053/-87.60282)).

**Additional info:** This workshop is an attempt to apply elements of
the
[Software Carpentry approach](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons)
(see also
[this article](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.3-62.v2)) to
interactive instruction for computing/quantitative sciences.
